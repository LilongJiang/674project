Work:
The code and document is written and edited by both.

How to run the program:
1. Install 'nltk', check http://nltk.org/install.html.
2. Install 'Beautiful Soup', check http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download.
3. Install 'numpy', check http://www.scipy.org/install.html. The only package you need to install is 'python-numpy'.
4. Make sure your computer is connected to the internet. It will download some nltk packages automatically at the first run. 
5. Setup a 'Data' directory under the same directory with main.py, and copy the sgm files into the directory.
6. In the terminal, input 'python main.py' to run the program.

Output:
freqVectors.txt stores the term frequency vector for each document.
tfidfVectors.txt stores the tf-idf vector for each document.
